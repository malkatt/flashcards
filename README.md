# flashcards
Python program to display flashcards from a dictionary and remove as the user learns the meaning.

"""

This flashcard program allows the user to ask for a glossary entry.

In response, the program randomly picks an entry from all glossary

entries. It shows the entry. After the user presses return, the

program shows the definition of that particular entry.

The user can repeatedly ask for an entry and also

has the option to quit the program instead of seeing

another entry.
